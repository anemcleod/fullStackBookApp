# Book Teaser

This concept was conceived as a creative solution to an author’s desire to independently publish a book. The site acts as an interactive teaser to entice visitors to purchase the book, but can also be used as a digital proposal to larger publishing houses. In addition to building this app, I conceptualized, designed and created all the artwork for this site.

This react app, tracks scrolling manipulate svgs and conditionally render sections of this digital pop up book. Dynamic styling of elements produces the illusion of an animated scene that is completely controlled by the user’s scrolling speed and direction.

## Technologies used

- react.js
- css

## Please note

The original artwork folders src/assets/introduction and src/assets/partone have been ommitted from the this public repo.
